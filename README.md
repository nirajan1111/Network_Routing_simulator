# NETWORK_ROUTING_SIMULATOR

## Overview
NETWORK_ROUTING_SIMULATOR is a web-based application built using React with TypeScript and Three.js. It provides a visual representation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm on a 3D Earth model. Users can place multiple objects on the surface of the Earth using simple mouse clicks and observe the shortest path for data travel from a start object to an end object.

## Features
- **3D Earth Visualization**: An interactive 3D model of the Earth using Three.js.
- **Object Placement**: Users can place multiple objects on the Earth's surface with mouse clicks.
- **Shortest Path Visualization**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find and visualize the shortest path between objects.
- **React and TypeScript**: Developed with modern web technologies for robust and scalable performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/NETWORK_ROUTING_SIMULATOR.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd NETWORK_ROUTING_SIMULATOR
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Click on the surface of the 3D Earth to place objects.
3. Select a start object and an end object.
4. The application will compute and display the shortest path between the selected objects using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions, including the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
  - `assets/`: Static assets such as images and models.
